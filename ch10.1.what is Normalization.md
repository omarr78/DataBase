## 🔁 Redundant Information & Update Anomalies

When data is **repeated unnecessarily** across multiple rows in a database table, it causes:

* **Wasted storage**
* **Update problems** called **anomalies**

### ⚠️ Common Update Anomalies

Let's use the relation:

```plaintext
EMP_PROJ(Emp#, Proj#, Ename, Pname, No_hours)
```

---

### 🛠 1. **Update Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem:**
If the name of a project (e.g., Proj# = P1) is changed from *"Billing"* to *"Customer-Accounting"*,
you must manually update **every record** for employees working on that project.

📌 **Risk:** If you forget one, you’ll have **inconsistent data**.

---

### ➕ 2. **Insertion Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem 1:**
You **can't add a new project** unless there is an employee assigned to it.

🔸 **Problem 2:**
You **can't add a new employee** unless they are already assigned to a project.

📌 **Result:** You are **blocked** from inserting valid data.

---

### ❌ 3. **Deletion Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem 1:** When a project is deleted, it will result in deleting all the employees who work on that project.

🔸 **Problem 2:** If an employee is the **only one** working on a project, deleting that employee may cause the **project to be lost too**.

📌 **Result:** You might lose **important data** by mistak.

## ✅ **Normalization** — *Definition*

To overcome problems like **redundancy**, **inconsistencies**, and **update anomalies**,
we apply **Normalization**.

**Normalization** is the process of organizing data and decomposing the bad relations by breaking up their attributes into smaller relations according to rules (normal forms) designed to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.

* so the question is what are the conditions that make me able to break down that single table that has Anomalies and redundancy to the small tables to make every table well-designed and have no Anomalies?

* so, we should study functional Dependencies.

## 🔁 **Functional Dependency (FD)**

A **functional dependency** describes a relationship between attributes in a relation.

> If `X → Y`, it means:
> “The value of attribute X **determines** the value of attribute Y.”

📌 **Y is functionally dependent on X**

---

### 🔍 **Examples of FDs**

| Attribute(s)                | Meaning                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SSN → Ename`               | A Social Security Number determines an employee name    |
| `Pnum → {Pname, Plocation}` | A project number determines project name and location   |
| `{SSN, Pnum} → Hours`       | An employee + project combination determines work hours |

---

## 🔧 **Types of Functional Dependencies**

1. ### ✅ **Full Functional Dependency**

   * Attribute is dependent on the **entire primary key**, not just a part.
   * Example: `{SSN, Pnum} → Hours`
     → Hours depends on both SSN and Pnum.

2. ### ⚠️ **Partial Dependency**

   * Attribute depends on only a **part of a composite key**.
   * Example: `Pnum → Pname`
     → Pname only depends on Pnum, not the full key `{SSN, Pnum}`.

3. ### 🔁 **Transitive Dependency**

   * A non-key attribute depends on another **non-key** attribute.
   * Example:

     * `SSN → Dno`, and
     * `Dno → Dname`
       → So `SSN → Dname` is **transitive**

---

> 🎯 The goal:
> Each table should represent **one concept**, contain **only necessary attributes**, and support **safe data updates**.
