## 🔁 Redundant Information & Update Anomalies

When data is **repeated unnecessarily** across multiple rows in a database table, it causes:

* **Wasted storage**
* **Update problems** called **anomalies**

### ⚠️ Common Update Anomalies

Let's use the relation:

```plaintext
EMP_PROJ(Emp#, Proj#, Ename, Pname, No_hours)
```

---

### 🛠 1. **Update Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem:**
If the name of a project (e.g., Proj# = P1) is changed from *"Billing"* to *"Customer-Accounting"*,
you must manually update **every record** for employees working on that project.

📌 **Risk:** If you forget one, you’ll have **inconsistent data**.

---

### ➕ 2. **Insertion Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem 1:**
You **can't add a new project** unless there is an employee assigned to it.

🔸 **Problem 2:**
You **can't add a new employee** unless they are already assigned to a project.

📌 **Result:** You are **blocked** from inserting valid data.

---

### ❌ 3. **Deletion Anomaly**

🔸 **Problem 1:**
• When a project is deleted, it will result in deleting all the employees who work on that project.

🔸 **Problem 2:**
If an employee is the **only one** working on a project, deleting that employee may cause the **project to be lost too**.

📌 **Result:** You might lose **important data** by mistak.
