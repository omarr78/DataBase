## 📊 What is a Data Model?

A **data model** is a set of concepts used to describe:

* The **structure** of a database (like data types, relationships, and constraints)
* The **operations** for storing, retrieving, and updating data

It achieves *abstraction* and helps us to how we view data, making it easier to design and work with databases.

## 📚 Categories of Data Models

Data models are divided into **three main types**, based on how close they are to real-world understanding or actual storage.

---

### 1. 🔍 High-Level (Conceptual) Data Models

These models are **close to how humans think about data**. They are used during the **early stages of database design**.

#### Concepts used:

* **Entities** – Real-world objects (e.g., Student, Course)
* **Attributes** – Properties of entities (e.g., Name, Age)
* **Relationships** – Connections between entities (e.g., A Student *enrolls in* a Course)

#### Example:

**Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**

> 📌 Used by database designers to plan the structure before implementation.

---


### 2. 🗃️ Representational (Implementation) Data Models

These are **used most often in real systems** like commercial databases.

They:

* Are **closer to how data is stored**, but still understandable by users
* **Hide complex storage details** but are ready to be implemented

#### Most common example:

**Relational Data Model**

* Uses **tables** to store data (called relations)
* Each table has **rows** (records) and **columns** (attributes)

#### Example:

> 📌 These tables are easy for users to understand and use with SQL.

---

### 3. 💾 Low-Level (Physical) Data Models

These describe **how data is stored** inside the computer – useful for **computer experts**, not general users.

#### Focuses on:

* **Record formats** (how data is structured in files)
* **Record ordering** (the sequence in which records are stored)
* **Access paths** – special structures used to find data faster

#### Example:

* **Index**: Like a book index, it helps quickly find a specific item (e.g., find a student by ID instead of searching every record).

---

## 🎯 Summary

* 🧠 **Conceptual**: What data do we need?
* 🛠️ **Representational**: How can we organize it in a system?
* 💻 **Physical**: How do we store and retrieve it efficiently from hardware?
---

## 🧱 Schemas, Instances, and Database State

When working with databases, it's important to understand the difference between the **structure** of the data and the **actual data**.

---

### 🔧 1. **Database Schema** (Structure)

* The **schema** is the **blueprint or design** of the database.
* It defines **what data** will be stored and **how it will be organized**.
* Created during **database design** and **doesn't change often**.

📌 Think of a **schema** like the **design plan of a building** — walls, rooms, layout — but not the furniture or people inside.

---

### 📄 2. **Schema Construct** (part of schema)

Each component of the schema (like a table or a field) is called a **schema construct**.

> Examples: `STUDENT`, `COURSE`, or even individual attributes like `Name`, `CourseID`.

---

### 📊 3. **Database State (Snapshot / Instance)** (the actual data)

* The **state** of a database is the **actual data stored** at a specific moment.
* It **changes frequently** — every time data is added, updated, or deleted.

📌 Think of it like the **furniture and people currently inside the building** (which can change), while the walls and rooms (the schema) stay mostly the same.
---

## 🧱 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence

The **Three-Schema Architecture** is designed to separate **what users see** from **how the data is actually stored**. This makes database systems more **flexible**, **secure**, and **easier to manage**.

### 📚 The Three Levels of the Architecture

#### 1. **Internal Level** (How Data is Stored)

* Describes **how** data is physically stored on disk.
* Uses **physical data models** (files, indexes, etc.).
* Managed by the DBMS – **users don’t see this**.

🧠 Example: A student record might be stored in a binary file with indexes for faster search. Users don’t need to know this.

---

#### 2. **Conceptual Level** (What Data Exists)

* Describes the **logical structure** of the **entire** database.
* Includes **entities**, **relationships**, **data types**, and **constraints**.
* Hides physical storage details.

---

#### 3. **External Level** (User Views)

* Each user or group sees only **part** of the database relevant to them.
* Hides unnecessary details.

🧠 Example:

* The finance department may only see `StudentID` and `TuitionFee`.
* A professor may only see `StudentID`, `Name`, and `Grades`.

These are called **external schemas or views**.

---

```{text}
  [External Level]     ← Different views for different users
        |
  [Conceptual Level]   ← Full logical design of the database
        |
  [Internal Level]     ← Physical storage details
```

## 🔓 Data Independence – What Is It?

**Data Independence** means you can change the **schema** at one level without affecting the other levels. It helps keep the system flexible and easy to update.

There are **two types**:

---

### 1. **Logical Data Independence**

* Ability to change the **conceptual schema** without changing **user views (external schemas)**.

🧠 Example:
You add a `PhoneNumber` field to the `STUDENT` table.
The **finance view**, which only needs `StudentID` and `TuitionFee`, **doesn’t need to change**.

✅ Helps developers update the logical design without breaking user programs.

---

### 2. **Physical Data Independence**

* Ability to change the **internal schema** (e.g., file structures) without changing the **conceptual schema**.

🧠 Example:
You create a new **index** to make searching faster.
But the logical structure (`STUDENT(StudentID, Name, Major)`) **stays the same**, so the rest of the system is **unaffected**.

✅ Helps DBAs improve performance without changing how users see the data.
