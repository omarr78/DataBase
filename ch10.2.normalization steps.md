## first normal forms:

### Disallows:

- Composite attribute

- Multi-value attribute

- Nested relation(non atomic attribute)

EX: 

![fnormal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67adc228-6980-4802-9503-1fb498f78d80)

- so we will create a new table containing key attributes(ssn) and (Pnumber),(Hour).

---

## Second Normal Form:

- must be first normal form

- Disallow Partial Dependency

- A relation schema R is in second normal form (2NF) if every non-prime attribute A in R is fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

so we will create a new table containing key attribute (Pnumber) and attributes with partial dependency like (Plocation),(pname)>>[fd3] and another table containing key attribute (ssn) with partial dependency (Ename)>>[fd2]

**any non-key attribute depends on a part of a primary key separate them in a single table.**

---
## Third Normal Form

- must be second normal form
- Disallow transitive Dependency
- Transitive Dependency → non-prime attribute depend on another non- prime attribute

**so we will create a new table containing the non-prime attributes (Dname,Dmge_ssn) and the attribute which depends on (Dnumber)**

---
## Boyce Codd Normal Form

- BCNF :X → A, X must be super-key in this relation even if A is prime attribute

- Any relation in BCNF is a 3NF, but not the opposite

**so we will create a new table containing the attribute (Advisor) and the attribute which depends on (Advisor)**
