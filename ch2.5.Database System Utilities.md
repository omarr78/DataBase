## ðŸ”§ Database Utilities

Most **DBMSs** (Database Management Systems) come with **tools** that help the **Database Administrator (DBA)** manage, optimize, and protect the database.

Here are the **main types of utilities** and what they do:

---

### 1. **Loading Utility**

ðŸ”¹ **What it does:**
Loads data from external files (like `.txt`, `.csv`, or other formats) **into the database**.

ðŸ”¹ **How it works:**
You tell the utility:

* What the **source file** format is
* What the **target database** format should be

Then it automatically **converts and stores** the data properly in the database.

ðŸ”¹ **Example:**
Loading student records from a spreadsheet (`students.csv`) into a `Student` table in a university database.

---

### 2. **Backup Utility**

ðŸ”¹ **What it does:**
Creates a **copy of the entire database** to be used in case of failure or data loss.

ðŸ”¹ **Why it matters:**
If the disk crashes or data gets corrupted, you can **restore** everything from the backup.

ðŸ”¹ **Types:**

* **Full Backup:** Backs up the whole database.
* **Incremental Backup:** Only backs up changes made since the **last backup**.
  âž¤ Saves storage but is more complex to restore.

### 3. **Database Storage Reorganization**

ðŸ”¹ **What it does:**
**Reorganizes files and storage structures** to improve performance.

ðŸ”¹ **Why itâ€™s used:**

* To **change file formats**
* To create or rebuild **indexes**
* To remove **fragmentation** in storage

ðŸ”¹ **Example:**
If a table grows too large and becomes slow to access, the DBA may reorganize it by **reindexing** or changing the file layout to improve speed.

---

### 4. **Performance Monitoring Utility**

ðŸ”¹ **What it does:**
**Tracks and reports** on how the database is being used.

ðŸ”¹ **What it shows:**

* Query performance
* Frequency of table usage
* Disk read/write stats
* Slow-running operations

ðŸ”¹ **Why it matters:**
The DBA uses this information to **make decisions**, such as:

* Should an index be added to speed up queries?
* Should files be reorganized?
* Are users overloading the system?
